                  <small>April 2024 - Present </small>
                  <p>During my four-month summer internship at the Simulation, Modeling and Synthetic Data lab, I am engaging in advanced research on privacy for synthetic data. My focus is on exploring differential privacy 
                    in generative models such as Banksformer, TimeGAN, and DoppelGANger, particularly in the contexts of financial and healthcare data. My responsibilities include delving into privacy preservation techniques 
                    and conducting practical experiments using the Banksformer model across different domains. This role requires me to thoroughly understand and manage the existing codebase, ensuring that I contribute effectively to the lab's privacy research objectives.

                  <p>I contributed significantly to software infrastructure improvements through a series of key initiatives. I engineered a Python module to streamline SSH management, which included features for key installation, remote access, and robust error handling. Additionally, I automated the 
                    build and deployment pipeline for Jekyll-based websites, using Cedar's computational resources to ensure efficient building and consistent deployment on the MUN server. I also improved the flexibility of Singularity containers by adding 
                    overlay images, enabling customization without altering their base configurations. Beyond these projects, I worked on various other small tasks as needed by the team, adapting to diverse technical challenges and supporting ongoing operations.</p>
